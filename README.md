Coffee Leaf Diseases Identification Project
This project focuses on the identification of coffee leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The project classifies coffee leaf images into four primary categories: miner, nodisease, phoma, and rust.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an effective image classification model that can accurately distinguish between different diseases affecting coffee leaves. The model is trained on a dataset of coffee leaf images and evaluated on unseen data to measure its performance.

Dataset
The dataset contains images of coffee leaves categorized into four classes:

miner
nodisease
phoma
rust
The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, with an 80-10-10 split.

Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, culminating in a dense output layer with a softmax activation function. The model structure is designed to capture the intricate patterns in the leaf images that are indicative of each disease.

Key Layers:
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input images.
MaxPooling Layers: Downsample the feature maps.
Dense Layers: Classify the extracted features into one of the four classes.
Data Augmentation
Data augmentation techniques such as random flipping and rotation are applied to the training dataset to improve the model's generalization capabilities.

Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss. Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting, and the model's performance is monitored using validation loss.

Hyperparameters:
Batch Size: 32
Image Size: 256x256 pixels
Channels: 3 (RGB)
Epochs: 50
Results
The model achieves a high level of accuracy on the validation and test datasets. The training process is visualized using plots of accuracy and loss over the training epochs.
